# BAE

BAE is a webapp used to prevent meetings that should've been an email. The host sets the meeting beforehand, and the atendees up/downvote the agenda items they feel need to be discussed. If an items has negative votes, it switches to a BAE (Been An Email) item.

It was using React, Node, Express, MongoDB

## Starting the app locally
Clone the directory and change into the root directory. Run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any API requests from the client.
